<!--img tag -->

<img src="galaxy.jpg" alt="galaxy image"  title="This is a galaxy picture" width="" height="" loading="lazy">

<!--loading has two options:
 1. eager:- loads img as early as can.
 2. lazy:- loads img when it's about to show.

 # use lazy so the image will load when we required or when it about to show
   so the site will load much faster.
