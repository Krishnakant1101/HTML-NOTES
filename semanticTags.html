<!--Definition and Usage
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A <header> element typically contains:

one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
logo or icon
authorship information
Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed
      within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.-->
        <header>
            <h1>Main page heading here</h1>
            <p>Posted by John Doe</p>
          </header>
        
        
        
        
        
          <!--The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.
        
        The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not contain
            any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright
            information, site logos, and search forms.
        
        Note: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document. The <main> element must NOT 
              be a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.-->

            The <footer> tag in HTML is used to define the footer section of a webpage or a specific section within the page. This area typically contains information like:
        
        Copyright details
        Contact information
        Links to privacy policy or terms of service
        Social media links

          <!--The <aside> tag in HTML is used to define content that is indirectly related to the main content 
            of the webpage. It is typically used for sidebars, pull quotes, additional notes, or related information 
            that enhances the primary content but isn't essential to its understanding.
        
        Key Points about the <aside> Tag:
        Supplementary content: It holds information that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars, ads, or references.
        Placement: It can be placed inside or outside of <main>. When inside, it typically applies to a specific section of the page. When outside, it can apply to the entire page.
        Accessibility: Helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand that the content is not part of the main flow but provides extra or related information.-->

        The <details> tag in HTML is used to create interactive disclosure widgets, where users can hide or reveal additional information on demand. The content inside the <details> element is hidden by default, and it can be toggled to be shown or hidden by clicking.
        
        Typically, it is used in combination with the <summary> tag, which provides a visible heading that users can click to expand or collapse the details.
        
        Key Points about the <details> Tag:
        Interactive element: It allows users to show or hide content, useful for FAQs, additional notes, or instructions.
        Built-in functionality: No need for JavaScript to handle the expand/collapse behaviorâ€”this is built into the browser.
        Accessibility: Improves accessibility by providing a clear way for users to interact with hidden content.-->

        The <mark> tag in HTML is used to highlight or "mark" text that is of relevance or importance in a particular context. It visually emphasizes the text by highlighting it (usually with a yellow background by default), similar to how you would use a highlighter on paper.
        
        Key Points about the <mark> Tag:
        Purpose: It indicates text that has special relevance, such as search results or important information within a larger body of text.
        Default styling: The browser typically highlights text with a yellow background and black text, though you can customize it using CSS.
        Accessibility: It helps visually distinguish key information, making it useful in search result pages, notes, or highlights.-->
